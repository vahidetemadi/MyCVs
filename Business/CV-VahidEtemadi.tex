\begin{tabularcv}
Sep 2014 - Aug 2021 &	\worktitle{Graduate Researcher at Distributed Systems Lab, \href{https://sutech.ac.ir/en} {Shiraz University of Technology}, Shiraz, Iran}
\newline
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Making software maintenance more automated through focusing on bug locating and task assignment.
		\item Providing a scheduling-driven approach with the objective of \emph{Time} and \emph{Cost} reduction in task assignment of software projects. We created a task dependency graph of input bugs and recommend the fixers based on a SBSE approach
		\item Defining \emph{Knowledge Diffusion} as the objective during a search-based task assignment for making development team more robust to developer churn.
		\newline (*) During my PhD, my main PL for implementation were Java (usually used Python as a complement too)
